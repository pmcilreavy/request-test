# request-test

This starts an http-server on port 4000 and serves up a simple html file.

I used this for testing a particular network connectivity issue I was having.

## Usage

To run, just double-click the following PowerShell core file...

`start.ps1`

Or run the these commands form the command line...

`npm install`

`npm start`
